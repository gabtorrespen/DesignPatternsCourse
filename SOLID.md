# Solid principles

## Single responsability

- Any particular class should have only one reason to exist or change
- All methods in a class exist to suffice one particular functionality or reason
- Separation of concerns. One class one concern

## Open-closed 

- Open for extension. Close for modification
- Usually accomplished using inheritance by having interfaces that allow us to extend the functionality


# Patterns

## Specification pattern

- Whether or not an item satisfies some particular criteria
